== Introduction
Daily use of Fedora Silverblue as an acceptable workstation is not so easy as its
wonderfully seamless installation process would belie. Independence of the OS and
the Apps, with respect to updates/upgrades is a benefit to stability and security.
The benefits and pitfalls can come to the forefront when pushing the use case. Which
currently doesn't seem to need much of a push. The writing of this document is being
done using Atom as a flatpak on Fedora Silverblue 29. Atom comes with a plethora of
plugins called packages, that can be of immense use for document creation and editing.
Things like linters for various writing foibles. One such is Proselint, for which
there is a Package in Atom. Proselint is useful to help with your writing clarity.
The Proselint Package installs fine in the Atom flatpak being used on Silverblue,
but gives an error about not finding proselint. Of course, proselint needs to be
installed, and can be via rpm-ostree with the command `~]$ rpm-ostree install proselint`,
followed by the command `~]$ systemctl reboot` to boot into the new image. Once
back up and logged in, run proselint in the terminal on the file with the expected
results, yet Atom still does not find proselint when the Proselint package tool
is run. For now, the Proselint Package in Atom is disabled and the solution is to
use the command line `~]$ proselint <filename>` to check the file in a terminal.
This does point to a type of issue faced in using Fedora Silverblue as a daily workstation,
flatpak app and host apps interaction, specifically there normally is none. Do I
submit a bug to Silveblue? Atom? the Proselint Atom Package support? Is it a bug
in the first place, and not just that my way of thinking about a workstation is
in need of revision? As this example has shown, the immediate solution to the problem
was to use a layered application in a terminal to check the file that is saved by
the Atom flatpak. That isn't the satisfactory one though, and it doesn't make for
the kind of user experience that has come to be expected.

== Installing Fedora Silverblue

The installation instructions for Silverblue can be found https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/installation-guide/[here] and are thorough, with links there to the Fedora Installation Guide as well as some other sources of reference material for Silverblue. While it is detailed and easy to follow, like many installation documents, doesn't fill in answers a user may have pre-installation.

.Layering
****
In the issue noted in the Introduction, the package Proselint was layered onto the rpm-ostree to solve the lacking proselint executable. If you have a preferred terminal to use, it should be layered too.
****
Answers to such questions as, Do I want to encrypt my storage media? Am I going to use the standard RXVT terminal or do I want TMUX and Terminator, or just Terminator, and how does it need to be set up? These are only a basic selection of the many potential questions that may plague a user intending on using Fedora Silverblue as their daily workstation, and we haven't even contemplated the immutable OS much yet. Each use case draws its own set of questions needing answers to facilitate a successful installation. Throughout, and integral to these many faceted usage environments, are the individual tasks all of us users do to set up our computing environment to suit our use case needs. These tasks are the procedure we follow, whether recorded for reference or not, each time we go through the process of setting up our workstation's. Some, as indicated https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/how-i-automated-my-fedora-workstation-with-modular-ansible-roles/579/4[here] in a discussion at fedoraproject.org have automated their workstation setup, in this case using Ansible Roles. Then there are a couple of examples of using github to have a repo for a convenient way of being able to setup/reset a system to a known state. At a discussion about suggested approaches to correctly setup Silverblue https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/what-is-the-suggested-approach-es-to-correctly-set-up-a-silverblue-workstation/432[here] examples of that were offered as potential answers.

=== Containers vs Flatpak vs Package Layering

Through the course of using Silverblue daily, it has become apparent that an orchestration
of all three technologies is what occurs in fact. There are times when a Container
will provide the flexibility required that a Flatpak cannot, Layering can sometimes
be the only answer to a problem, and Flatpaks in general work fine as they are intended.
This is very likely echoed elsewhere throughout any community of users of an OSTree
type of OS, whether Silverblue or others that use libostree. To successfully navigate
this terrain it's good to be up on all things rpm-ostree, all things flatpak, and
a whole lot of things container related.

Each of the technologies expose varying levels of access to the OS image, with the
Layering approach being the most intrusive in the fact it causes a new image tree
to be created. The Flatpak application is definitely the least intrusive being sandboxed,
with limited indirect access and limited developer capabilities to program in access
to system resources. Containers have more access to system processes and devices.

NOTE: Need verification and details here about the different roles of each.

As stated on https://flatpak.org/[flatpak.org] 'Flatpak is a next-generation technology
for building and distributing desktop applications on Linux. Flatpak uses libostree
to store application data, distinct from the host system management model.' In
practice, what this means is that the flatpak deployment of an application does not
normally have access to the host OS directly, or any other applications running on
the host. The application is running on a runtime contained inside of the flatpak
itself. If this sounds a lot like a flatpak is a container, it's because it is a
container essentially. An application in flatpak form is running inside of its own environment
designed specifically to make it work as intended, irrespective of the host OS,
and is quite effectively sandboxed. One of Flatpakâ€™s main goals is to increase the
security of desktop systems by isolating applications from one another. This is
achieved using sandboxing and means that, by default, applications that are run
with Flatpak have extremely limited access to the host environment. For day to day
usage in roles that encompass the bulk of things users generally are doing at their
PC Silverblue, with its immutable OS and flatpak'd applications proves to function
quite well. The updates are rolling along regularly just like the Fedora Workstation
I had become used to, and the majority of my applications that are flatpak's work
as they are intended to.

=== Using Flatpaks/Flathub

When you first run Silverblue after the initial installation steps, you will likely
want to install some applications, and to do that no doubt you first try Gnome
Software, only to find nothing. Gnome Software is still there, just not showing
software to install since the flatpak repository (flathub) is not configured for
the system yet. This is due entirely to the Fedora licensing scheme, since Flathub
allows software with non-open source license schemes to be distributed, like for
instance rpmfusion-nonfree repo does in the normal Workstation version of Fedora.
The user has to configure the rpmfusion-nonfree repo in order to install anything
from its repository. In Silverblue, when installing flatpak'd applications, you
have to configure the repository for use first. You do this with the `flatpak
remote-add` command. This command takes as its first argument, the name you want
to give the remote, and the URL it is located at for the second argument. In the
case of the flathub repository, I simply named mine `flathub` and its URL is
https://dl.flathub.org/repo/. The command becomes `flatpak remote-add flathub
"https://dl.flathub.org/repo/"` without the quotes. It is also acceptable, and
easier to browse to Flathub.org and select the quick setup option for Fedora, which
Installs the repo via Gnome Software. Whichever way you choose to do it, will result
in you now having access to all of the flatpak'd applications and extensions available
on the Flathub repo. These applications will be displayed as usual in Gnome Software
with their origin being dl.flathub.org. There are more applications being offered
as flatpak's each day it seems, so check back often if your favourite isn't listed
yet. There is more you can do with the repo now that you have it installed. The
flatpak command has numerous options that are useful for inspecting what is available
at a configured repo. The command `flatpak remotes` will list the installed/configured
repositories, and if you use the `-d` switch with the command like so `flatpak remotes -d`
you will get a detailed listing of your configured remotes (repo's).

NOTE: Flatpak refers to repositories as remotes, even if the repo exists on your own system.

Also, it is worth noting that there are other remotes available to be configured
on your system if you would like to explore some more. If you want to have Firefox
as a flatpak, instead of using the version shipped as part of the Ostree of Silverblue,
you could configure the firefox nighly remote (https://dl.flathub.org/repo/) with
the following command `flatpak remote-add firefox-nightly <https://dl.flathub.org/repo/>`
then install the FireFox nightly build with the command `flatpak
install firefox-nightly org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly` and flatpak will install the
Firefox nightly build for you. You may have already come to the conclusion that
you could also install it from Gnome Software since you have configured the remote,
and you would be correct but take note of the source listed on its install icon,
it is the remote you just configured. As no doubt. some of the clever monkeys out
there have likely noted when they did a remote-ls command on their configured
flathub remote, there are more things listed than the app's. There are runtimes,
and sdk's as well as app's since Flathub.org is a place to distribute such things.

==== Installing Flatpak Applications
===== Gnome Software
Gnome Software is the default graphical software installation application that
Silverblue comes installed with. Gnome Software provides the capability to
install Flatpak applications from online repositories. To see the list of
configured repositories, start up the Gnome Software application, open the
application menu in the upper right corner of the window, and then select
the `Software Repositories` menu item. A window will open with a list of the
installed software repositories. Unfortunately, Gnome Software does not provide
a way to add new repositories from it's graphical interface. To add the
'flathub.org' repository, use the following instructions.

====== Installing Flathub Repository
To setup Flathub you need to open up the web browser (Firefox) and go to the
https://flathub.org/home URL. On the home page click the button for
'Quick Setup'.

image::sfg_flathub_home.png[title="Flathub home page"]

The Flathub setup page will show options to select from several operating system
choices. Click on the Fedora logo to start the setup process for Silverblue.

image::sfg_flathub_quicksetup.png[title="Flathub quick setup page"]

The next page will give you some information on the Fedora quick setup. Click
on the `Flathub repository file` button to start the download of the Flathub
repository installation file.

image::sfg_flathub_fedora.png[title="Flathub quick setup page"]

A popup window will show download option for the file. The "Open with" option
should show Software Install (default). For some reason you cannot choose the
"Do this automatically for files like this from now on" option. Click on the
`OK` button to start the download.

image::sfg_flathub_download.png[title="Flathub download options"]

After the download is complete, a new window will open showing the Flathub
repository install options. This window also shows the source location of the
repository to be installed under the details heading (1). To start the
installation of the Flathub repository, click on the `Install` button (2).

image::sfg_flathub_install.png[title="Flathub install window"]

After the repository install process is complete, the window will be updated to
show a `Remove` button in place of the `Install` button. Close the window (1).

image::sfg_flathub_finish.png[title="Flathub install complete"]

Now, if you go back to Gnome Software you should see Flathub listed in the
'Software Repositories' (1).

image::sfg_repositories.png[title="Gnome Software repositories"]

====== Installing Flatpak Application from Flathub
Now that the Flathub repository is configured you can install some Flatpak software
applications from Flathub. The following example shows how to install the
LibreOffice software application Flatpak from the Flathub repository.

Open the web browser (Firefox) and go to the http://flathub.org/home page. Search
for LibreOffice and click on the link to open the LibreOffice details page. Click
on the `Install` button (1) to start the install or see below about reviewing the
other info on the detail page.

image::sfg_libreoffice_info1.png[title="LibreOffice details page"]

The details below the `Install` button include a link to a setup guide
for LibreOffice that should be reviewed before beginning the install to see if any
pre-installation configuration actions are required. There is also some screen shots
of the application windows to give a preview of what the application interface looks
like. Below the screenshots is a description of the software application.

Further down the page under the "Additional Information" is information about the
last update date for the Flatpak (1), the software version(2), and the license
information (3). Some repositories may not have the latest software version of
the application and some repositories contain non-free software licensed
applications. Review this information to be sure it meets your needs. There is
also a command line instruction to install the Flatpak (4).

image::sfg_libreoffice_info2.png[title="LibreOffice Additional Information"]

After clicking the `Install` button, a download information window will be shown.
Verify the correct Flatpak is being downloaded and then click on the `OK` button
to begin installing the LibreOffice application.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak download"]

Once the Flatpak is downloaded, the Gnome Software application will open a new
window with an `Install` button (1). This window also shows details again about
the Flatpak application (2). Notice that LibreOffice is Sandboxed. This means it
will have limited interaction with other application and the operating system for
improved security. Also, there is no localization of languages for this application,
so you may need to install additional extensions to provide support for your language.
Finally, there is no documentation provided with the Flatpak. Click on the `Install`
button to begin the installation.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install2.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak Install]

Once the installation begins, the window will show a progress bar and a `Cancel`
button (1). It can take some time for LibreOffice download to complete. While
you are waiting, you can get ready to write a review of the application by clicking
the `Write a Review` button (2). This will open a window where you can get ready
to fill in your review comments after the install is complete and you have tried
out the application.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install3.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak Installing]

After the installation is successfully completed, you should see the LibreOffice
application listed in Gnome Software after you reboot Silverblue (yes, this is a bug).

=== Removing Flathub Repository
If you no longer want to use the Flathub repository, you can remove it with the
following instructions.

IMPORTANT: All Flatpak applications that were installed from the Flathub repository
must be uninstalled first or else you will get an error when trying to remove the
Flathub repository (see Removing Flatpak Applications).

Open the Gnome Software application menu and select repositories. You will see
a window open with the list of currently installed repositories. Click on the
Flathub repository list item (1) and it will expand to show the hidden `Remove...`
button (2). Click on the `Remove...` button (2) and then a confirmation window
will open. Click on `Remove` button (1) to complete removing the Flathub repository.

=== Example Pet Container Usage

On Fedora Silverblue,  there is an out of the box solution provided for a Pet Container, fedora-toolbox. If it isn't already installed for you, you can do so with the following command `~[$ rpm-ostree install fedora-toolbox`, once it is installed, you'll have to reboot into the new image with `~[$ systemctl reboot`. When your image comes back you can begin with fedora-toolbox immediately by creating an image based upon your current system installation, including your home directory setup with dotfiles and all. To create an image this way type `~[$ fedora-toolbox create`, that will create a toolbox container for you, based upon an image of your current system setup. To use the container, you simply enter `~[$ fedora-toolbox enter` and you should now be at a prompt that looks like this in my case ðŸ”¹[user@toolbox ~]$ instead of my normal prompt in Fedora Silverblue which is this Lx î‚± user@localhost î‚° ðŸ˜ˆ  ~ î‚°

NOTE: The prompts as displayed, are normal for my system setup. They will very likely be different on your system.
